# OTTPlay Native for LG webOS

This is a separate, experimental **native OTT player**. Its SDL2/OpenGL ES
interface runs on the television without Chromium or a WebView. Media is
demultiplexed by the bundled FFmpeg and sent to the television's native decoder.
The UI and Plex runtime derive from
[PlxNative](https://github.com/GLinnik21/plx-native), pinned by `upstream.json`.
Our reviewed changes are in `patches/`; upstream code is fetched during the
build, not silently copied into the main player's source tree.

The application ID is `com.openottplay.player.native`, the title is **OTTPlay
Native**. Native **0.2.0** is published as
[native-webos-v0.2.0-beta.1](https://github.com/open-ott-play/ottplay-foss/releases/tag/native-webos-v0.2.0-beta.1).
Publication does not establish physical-TV acceptance. The
existing `com.openottplay.player` hosted web application remains separate.

## What this target provides

The native interface provides M3U, Xtream, Stalker, VPortal, local folders and Plex as provider profiles, with a linear channel/video list, categories, full descriptions and artwork where the source supplies them. Saved profiles, selection, Favorites and playback position use the protected native store. Local files are read from their source, without an import copy.

Global Favorites can mix providers and profiles. Their portable identities bind to the receiving player's own matching profiles, source aliases and paths; credentials are not copied through a Favorite. Missing or ambiguous bindings are reported instead of choosing an unrelated source. The legacy form of a portal embedded inside an M3U profile is retained in Favorites but is not a supported native binding.

Older local Favorites that retained only a filename can have lost their parent folders. The native client cannot distinguish such a truncated path from a genuine root-level file with the same name. Recreate those Favorites from their full relative paths before transfer; compatibility with that legacy capture format is not yet complete.

Command-server discovery and pairing use this installation's own device identity. The native command adapter implements profile and provider selection, global Favorites transfer, playback, validated individual settings and Standby. Async operations report completion after the relevant work; a queued command cannot silently act after its deadline or a change of source. Interface font scale is adjustable from 20 to 200 percent, with 100 percent as the default.

The original native Plex library views remain available. Plex playback uses the existing server session and conversion path. Direct Local/HTTP playback uses the bundled FFmpeg probe and the television's decoder. Generic HLS currently supports ordinary unencrypted MPEG-TS H.264/AAC streams, VOD seeking and live refresh, with a 64 MiB limit per segment. Encrypted HLS, fMP4, byte ranges, LL-HLS, separate audio/video renditions and adaptive variant switching are not implemented in this path. Container recognition does not guarantee codec support: an AVI containing MPEG4/Xvid still needs a compatible conversion.

The optional packaged companion runs as a separately supervised process on an authenticated loopback endpoint, with an ephemeral token, bounded sessions and bounded disk usage. Its configuration is separate from the native provider profiles. An absent helper or unsupported capability is reported explicitly. A companion-enabled package requires the helper's verified binary, linker evidence and corresponding source; a local-source-only receipt is insufficient for publication.

Catalogues currently have explicit 50,000-entry and 32 MiB model limits. A limit produces a visible partial-catalogue error. Cancelling a scan stops subsequent work, but cannot interrupt a kernel filesystem call already blocked on an unavailable network mount.

This remains an experimental target. Host and ARM checks do not establish physical-TV playback, video-plane composition or firmware compatibility. Device-specific acceptance and known limits must accompany each release; no performance result is inferred from the upstream application.

## Build on an Apple Silicon Mac or ARM Linux host

Use Python 3.12+, Git, make, a C build environment and rustup. The pinned native
SDK supports macOS arm64/x86_64 and Linux aarch64; an ordinary x86_64 Linux
runner is not supported by that SDK release. Native dependencies additionally
need CMake, Ninja, Meson, pkg-config, autoconf, automake and libtool. Docker is
not required. Allow several GiB for source, the SDK, Rust and intermediate
objects; no build command deletes other projects or global build caches.

From the repository root:

```sh
python3 native/webos/build.py all --jobs 2
```

For an existing SDK:

```sh
python3 native/webos/build.py all \
  --sdk /absolute/path/to/arm-webos-linux-gnueabi_sdk-buildroot \
  --work-dir /absolute/path/to/ottplay-native-build --jobs 2
```

`WEBOS_SDK` is also accepted. The SDK is downloaded only when the chosen
directory is absent, and its digest must match both manifests. The
SDK contains target-system absolute symlinks; extraction converts these to
relative links contained inside the target sysroot, while preserving the
archive path and link containment checks.
The selected Rust version is read from the pinned upstream `rust-toolchain.toml`; the ARMv7
GNU/Linux target and matching `rust-src` are installed through rustup. Android
ARM libraries are not interchangeable with webOS.

FFmpeg source downloads try the canonical `ffmpeg.org` release first, then
[MacPorts' distribution mirror](https://distfiles.macports.org/ffmpeg/) if the
origin remains unavailable after its bounded retries. Both locations must
supply the same pinned archive bytes. A checksum mismatch stops the build
immediately; it never falls through to another source. The fallback changes
only transport, not the recorded upstream origin, version, license or source
provenance. The integration patch is included in the corresponding source
archive for every native package.

The stages can also be run individually, using the same `--work-dir` and
`--sdk` arguments each time:

1. `prepare` fetches the exact commit, applies the overlay, and records its
   digest and patched Git tree. `--local-upstream /path/to/clone` can avoid downloading an existing
   clone; the exact commit is still checked.
2. `bootstrap` verifies/downloads the SDK and installs the pinned Rust target.
3. `build` normally runs `make RELEASE=1 FLAVOR=stable ipk`. With an explicit
   `--companion-bundle`, it validates that bundle, runs `ipk-stage`, stages the
   helper with private `--link-evidence`, then runs `ipk-pack`. It never contacts a TV.
4. `package` checks the native ARM executable, storage service, demuxer and
   package identity and the successful source-build receipt, then copies the independently named artifact.
5. `source` collects and verifies corresponding source, Cargo-vendored
   dependencies, bundled native dependencies and Rust runtime source.

After `all`, collect the additional GCC/glibc runtime sources and bind their
linker evidence to the exact package:

```sh
python3 scripts/webos-runtime-sources.py \
  --metadata build/native-webos/dist/ottplay-native-webos-0.2.0.json \
  --source build/native-webos/source \
  --sdk build/native-webos/toolchain/arm-webos-linux-gnueabi_sdk-buildroot
```

For a custom build directory, adjust these paths. Preserve the verified SDK
archive downloaded by `bootstrap`, or pass its location with `--sdk-archive`.
The collector checks linked runtime archives and objects against that pinned
SDK before claiming source coverage. `all` alone produces the primary source
archive; distribution requires this second step as well.

Default results are in `build/native-webos/dist/`. Keep these together:

- `ottplay-native-webos-0.2.0.ipk`
- `ottplay-native-webos-0.2.0.json` and `.sha256`
- `ottplay-native-webos-0.2.0-source.tar.gz` and its `.release.json` report
- `ottplay-native-webos-0.2.0-runtime-source.tar.gz`
- `ottplay-native-webos-0.2.0-source-set.json`
- `ottplay-native-webos-icon.png`

`verify` rechecks the IPK. Source-validation reports distinguish a verified
source archive from an independently rebuilt binary; they do not claim a
rebuild has occurred when it has not. A change to the source pin or overlay
requires a new build directory, so stale objects cannot silently enter a new
candidate.

The build receipt records the patched source tree, exact IPK hash, Rust
version and actual SDK compiler hash. Corresponding-source validation also
requires physical archives for every bundled native dependency, Cargo crates
and the Rust runtime; a list of download URLs alone does not pass.

### Favorites compatibility check

After `prepare` and installation of the repository's JavaScript development
dependencies, compare the native interchange fixture with the actual browser
codec and strict JSON parser:

```sh
node native/webos/test_favorites_conformance.cjs --check \
  build/native-webos/source/rust-modules/data/src/ott/fixtures/favorites-conformance.json
```

Adjust the source path for a custom `--work-dir`. The native Rust tests consume
the same fixture. A mismatch requires reviewing the format change and both
implementations; regenerating the fixture alone does not establish compatibility.

### Complete candidate build with companion

The complete experimental `0.2` candidate must include the companion and its
verified source closure. The native-only commands above remain useful for
isolated development but do not produce that complete candidate. This procedure
is not a record of a completed ARM build or TV test. Use the same pinned SDK and
original SDK archive throughout. Install host libclang first. The
[preparation step](companion/PREPARATION.md) installs the manifest-pinned Rust
toolchain (currently `1.96.1`) and ARM target, fills an explicit Cargo cache and
verifies the exact Rust source archive; it does not compile the player.
All paths below are placeholders. Use fresh bundle/source outputs and a fresh
native work directory; read versions from the manifests rather than reusing an
older release's filenames. Run the stages in order and stop if any command fails.

```sh
native_sdk="/absolute/path/to/arm-webos-linux-gnueabi_sdk-buildroot"
native_sdk_archive="/absolute/path/to/original-pinned-sdk.tar.bz2"
native_libclang="/absolute/path/to/libclang-directory"
native_companion_cache="/absolute/path/to/companion-cache"
native_companion_target="/absolute/path/to/companion-target"
native_companion_bundle="/absolute/path/to/new-companion-bundle"
native_companion_sources="/absolute/path/to/new-companion-sources"
native_preparation="$native_companion_cache/prepared.json"
native_work="/absolute/path/to/new-native-build"
native_version="$(python3 -c 'import json; print(json.load(open("native/webos/upstream.json"))["application"]["version"])')"

python3 native/webos/companion/prepare.py \
  --cache-dir "$native_companion_cache" \
  --libclang "$native_libclang" --target-dir "$native_companion_target" \
  --output "$native_preparation"

python3 - "$native_preparation" "$native_sdk" "$native_sdk_archive" \
  "$native_companion_bundle" "$native_companion_sources" <<'PY'
import json

from pathlib import Path
import subprocess
import sys

receipt, sdk, sdk_archive, bundle, sources = sys.argv[1:]
prepared = json.loads(Path(receipt).read_text())
environment = {**os.environ, **prepared["environment"]}
subprocess.run([
    sys.executable, "native/webos/companion/build.py", "build",
    "--sdk", sdk, "--sdk-archive", sdk_archive,
    "--libclang", prepared["libclang"], "--target-dir", prepared["target_dir"],
    "--output", bundle, "--jobs", "2",
], env=environment, check=True)
subprocess.run([
    sys.executable, "native/webos/companion/sources.py",
    "--bundle", bundle, "--output", sources,
    "--readelf", str(Path(sdk) / "bin/arm-webos-linux-gnueabi-readelf"),
    "--rust-sysroot", prepared["rust_sysroot"],
    "--rust-source-archive", prepared["rust_source_archive"],
], env=environment, check=True)
PY

python3 native/webos/build.py all \
  --companion-bundle "$native_companion_bundle" \
  --work-dir "$native_work" --sdk "$native_sdk" --jobs 2

python3 scripts/webos-runtime-sources.py \
  --metadata "$native_work/dist/ottplay-native-webos-${native_version}.json" \
  --source "$native_work/source" --sdk "$native_sdk" \
  --sdk-archive "$native_sdk_archive" \

  --companion-sources "$native_companion_sources"

python3 scripts/verify-webos-native-release.py \
  --metadata "$native_work/dist/ottplay-native-webos-${native_version}.json" \
  --check-checkout
```

Pass the preparation receipt's **entire `environment` object to both helper
subprocesses**, as above. This keeps the checked Cargo cache, pinned toolchain,
libclang and offline dependency access identical for build and source collection.
Use its exact `rust_sysroot` and `rust_source_archive` paths; do not substitute a
different installed toolchain or source download. Keep the same checkout, cache
and target directory through final SDK attestation. Preparation's `status: ready`
only confirms inputs. Source collection still records SDK runtime coverage as
`PENDING_ENCLOSING_RELEASE` until the enclosing runtime collector verifies the
helper's final-link inputs against the pinned SDK and supplies their sources.

Staging copies the helper manifest byte-for-byte and binds the packaged source
summary to the build receipt's local-input digest. The runtime collector embeds
`companion/companion-source.tar.gz` and its receipts inside the existing
`-runtime-source.tar.gz`; the release still has two top-level source archives.
Keep the helper bundle, source output and linker evidence until this collection
and final verification succeed. Those checks do not establish an independent
rebuild, real-device execution or functional parity.

## Install through LG Developer Mode

### Choose and verify the native package

The current experimental release is
[native-webos-v0.2.0-beta.1](https://github.com/open-ott-play/ottplay-foss/releases/tag/native-webos-v0.2.0-beta.1).
Download `ottplay-native-webos-0.2.0.ipk`, its `.sha256` and `.json` files, and
the matching source set from that release. From the download directory, check:

```sh
shasum -a 256 -c ottplay-native-webos-0.2.0.sha256
```

Use the [checked update guide](../../docs/native-webos-delivery.md) for an
existing installation. The initial
[0.1.0 release](https://github.com/open-ott-play/ottplay-foss/releases/tag/native-webos-v0.1.0-beta.1)
remains available; its device observations do not qualify 0.2.0.

The metadata must identify `type: native`, architecture `arm`, and application
ID **`com.openottplay.player.native`**. The ordinary OTT-play webOS package
uses **`com.openottplay.player`**. The Plex app from the LG store is a third,
independent application; launching it through a TV remote-control shortcut does
not launch OTTPlay Native. Main-player releases and here.now deployments do not
update this native executable.

The initial 0.1.0 candidate passed loader-symbol checks against sampled webOS 3.4.0–11.2.0
firmware images; sampled webOS 1.x/2.x images are unsupported. These checks do
not establish decoding, permissions or compatibility on a particular TV. Record
the actual model, webOS and firmware version before testing.

### Enable the TV connection

Follow [LG's Developer Mode instructions](https://webostv.developer.lge.com/develop/getting-started/developer-mode-app):

1. Connect the TV and computer to the same reachable local network.
2. Install **Developer Mode** from LG Apps on the TV and sign in with an LG
   Developer account. Account sign-in happens on the TV; it is not an SSH login.
3. Set **Dev Mode Status** to **ON** and allow the required TV restart.
4. Open Developer Mode again, confirm that the session is active, and set
   **Key Server** to **ON**. Keep this screen open while obtaining the key.

A responding web player or TV remote-control connection on ports 3000/3001
does not prove that Developer Mode is ready. Development SSH uses port **9922**;
the temporary Key Server used by the CLI uses port **9991**.

Install or locate the [webOS CLI](https://webostv.developer.lge.com/develop/tools/cli-introduction)
on the computer. These commands use `@webos-tools/cli` 3.2.6. A project-local
installation exposes commands under
`/path/to/installation/node_modules/.bin/`; use those full command paths if
`ares-install` is not on `PATH`. Use the CLI's `tv` profile. The placeholders
`YOUR_TV` and `TV_IP` below mean your chosen device alias and the TV's current
LAN address, not its OTT player name or Device ID.

```sh
ares-setup-device --list
ares-setup-device --add YOUR_TV \
  --info host=TV_IP --info port=9922 --info username=prisoner
ares-novacom --device YOUR_TV --getkey
```

If the alias already exists, inspect it and use `--modify YOUR_TV` instead of
creating a second entry. Enter the **current six-character, case-sensitive
Passphrase** displayed by the TV when `--getkey` prompts. It is not the LG
account password, OTT pairing code or the player HTTP access token. Use an
interactive terminal and wait for the prompt before typing: piping input before
the prompt can leave the saved passphrase unchanged even when the command exits
successfully. Do not put the passphrase in shell arguments, scripts, issue
reports or this repository.

On macOS/Linux with CLI 3.2.6's `tv` profile, device settings are normally in
`~/.webos/tv/novacom-devices.json` and the downloaded key is in
`~/.ssh/YOUR_TV_webos` (spaces in the alias are replaced with underscores).
The device configuration can contain the saved passphrase. Keep both private;
the key should have mode `0600`. Do not delete the whole device registry or SSH
directory to repair one TV.

### Prove access, install, then verify

Successful `--getkey` output means the key was downloaded and saved. It does
**not** prove that the supplied passphrase decrypts it or that SSH authentication
works. Both read-only checks must succeed before installation:

```sh
ares-device --device YOUR_TV --system-info
ares-install --device YOUR_TV --list
```

Confirm that the reported TV is the intended one, then install the verified IPK
and launch its native ID. Run this from the download directory, or substitute
the build output path `build/native-webos/dist/`:

```sh
ares-install --device YOUR_TV ./ottplay-native-webos-0.2.0.ipk
ares-install --device YOUR_TV --listfull
ares-launch --device YOUR_TV com.openottplay.player.native
ares-launch --device YOUR_TV --running
```

For a separately built and fully verified candidate, substitute its exact IPK
filename and verify its matching checksum and source set first. The old release
tag must not be used as a download location for a newer candidate.

Find the native application ID and version in `--listfull`, then check the TV
screen. An install or launch acknowledgement alone is not a playback test.
Sign in to Plex, open a
library, play a known file, and check visible video movement, sound, pause/resume,
seeking and the Back button. Close and reopen the app to verify its own saved
session. Keep a private receipt with the package hash, model/firmware, command
outcomes and observed playback result; exclude passwords, tokens and keys.

If an installation times out or loses its response, first run `--list` again
and inspect the TV. Do not blindly repeat installation or uninstall the app:
the first request may have succeeded. Resolve the actual installed state before
retrying.

Installation and launch of the released native **0.1.0** package were verified
on an **OLED65B4AUA.DUSQLJR**, webOS SDK **10.3.2**, firmware **33.31.75**.
`--listfull` confirmed the application ID/version, and `--running` confirmed
the launched process remained present. This is installation/startup evidence;
Plex playback and decoder compatibility on that TV are not yet verified.

The same released **0.1.0** package was also installed and launched on an
**OLED77C5PUA.DUSQLJR**, webOS SDK **11.2.0**, firmware **43.21.96**. Developer
connection and system information were verified, installation and launch
completed successfully, and `--running` confirmed the native application ID.
The IPK SHA256 matched the published release digest. This is installation and
startup evidence only; playback and decoder compatibility remain unverified on
this model as well. It does not qualify the published **0.2.0** package.

### Connection and startup troubleshooting

- **`ares-*` command not found:** locate the installed CLI binary directory.
  This is a computer-side path problem, not a reason to reset the TV.
- **Connection refused on 9922:** verify the address and active Dev Mode Status
  after the TV restart. A working browser/SSAP connection uses a different
  service. A network timeout can also indicate routing, VPN or firewall rules.
- **Key download fails on 9991:** open Developer Mode, enable Key Server and
  retry obtaining the key once it is reachable. Do not expose these ports to
  the public Internet.
- **`Cannot parse privateKey`, `Malformed OpenSSH private key` or `Bad passphrase`
  after a successful download:** re-read the current TV passphrase exactly,
  including case, and run `--getkey` again for the same alias. Do not guess codes
  or keep retrying installation. Then repeat `--system-info` and `--list`.
  If needed, `ssh-keygen -y -f /path/to/developer-key > /dev/null` checks key
  decryption locally with an interactive prompt; it does not test TV access.
  Persistent failure can mean a stale/corrupt key or a different CLI profile,
  alias or key path. Inspect only that connection before replacing anything.
- **SSH authentication rejected:** verify the `prisoner` user, port 9922,
  selected alias, current session and its downloaded key. The normal LG account
  password is not a substitute. Changing keys does not require clearing the
  player's profile or reinstalling it.
- **IPK installed but no usable picture:** confirm the native app ID was
  launched and distinguish an app-start failure from a media-decoder failure.
  Test a known Plex file and retain the exact error/model/firmware. The
  browser-based webOS simulator cannot verify the TV's native decoder. If the
  platform denies a native capability, use the existing hosted player while
  investigating; do not change platform permissions or install system packages.

#### CLI 3.2.6: `Callback was already called.`

This was reproduced with `@webos-tools/cli` **3.2.6** and Node **26.8.2** after
validating the key and passphrase. The CLI's TCP connection probe connected,
then socket closure emitted `ENOTCONN`, completing the same callback twice.
It was a CLI probe error, not a reason to reset the TV or obtain another key.

The optional [`ares-compat.cjs`](ares-compat.cjs) launcher guards that probe's
completion once, only for the exact reviewed CLI version and source hash.
It retains SSH authentication and original command options; it changes neither
the installed CLI files nor global `NODE_OPTIONS`. From the repository root:

```sh
node native/webos/ares-compat.cjs /path/to/node_modules/@webos-tools/cli \
  ares-device --device YOUR_TV --system-info
node native/webos/ares-compat.cjs /path/to/node_modules/@webos-tools/cli \
  ares-install --device YOUR_TV --listfull
```

The path identifies the CLI package directory, not its `.bin` directory.
After those checks succeed, the same launcher accepts `ares-install` and
`ares-launch` with the installation or launch arguments shown above. It refuses
an unreviewed version or source mismatch; do not weaken those checks to force
another CLI version through it. Normal CLI commands remain the first choice
when this specific failure is absent.

### Updates and Developer Mode expiry

Developer Mode is temporary. Use **EXTEND** in the TV's Developer Mode app while
the session is still active and the TV has network access. When Developer Mode
is disabled after expiry, LG removes development applications; their saved state
must not be assumed recoverable. Re-enable it and re-establish access before
reinstalling. Do not disable Developer Mode merely to troubleshoot an app.

For an update, first verify the new **native** package, its application ID and
matching source metadata. Close only this app, install over the same ID, verify
the installed version and reopen it:

```sh
ares-launch --device YOUR_TV --close com.openottplay.player.native
ares-install --device YOUR_TV /path/to/verified-native-update.ipk
ares-install --device YOUR_TV --listfull
ares-launch --device YOUR_TV com.openottplay.player.native
```

Do not uninstall first. Keep the previous verified package and any separately
managed private Plex configuration for recovery. In-place installation avoids
deliberate data deletion, but migration, retained sign-in and downgrades still
require verification; they are not guaranteed. The hosted player's profiles,
Favorites and command-server pairing are separate and are not imported by this
installation.

## Optional existing Plex configuration

The normal Plex sign-in remains available. The native runtime can also read a
private `ottplay-profile.json` from its installed application directory when
starting. For example:

```json
{
  "address": "https://plex.example.net",
  "token": "YOUR_PLEX_TOKEN",
  "serverId": "YOUR_PLEX_MACHINE_IDENTIFIER",
  "name": "Home Plex"
}
```

`baseUrl`, `server` and `url` are aliases for `address`; `machineIdentifier`
and `machineId` are aliases for `serverId`. A saved `plexcfg` object or a JSON
string containing that object is also accepted. The address must be an
origin, without a path, query or embedded credentials. HTTPS is the default.
HTTP requires `allowInsecureHttp: true`, a numeric private/loopback/link-local
address and an expected `serverId`; the runtime checks `/identity` before
sending credentials. Invalid configuration leaves normal sign-in available.

Keep this file outside the repository and public release output. The IPK
validator rejects packages containing it. On an already authorized Developer
Mode connection, if that account can write the installed app's directory:

```sh
chmod 600 ./ottplay-profile.json
scp -O -P 9922 -i /path/to/developer-key ./ottplay-profile.json \
  prisoner@TV_IP:/media/developer/apps/usr/palm/applications/com.openottplay.player.native/ottplay-profile.json
ssh -p 9922 -i /path/to/developer-key prisoner@TV_IP \
  'chmod 600 /media/developer/apps/usr/palm/applications/com.openottplay.player.native/ottplay-profile.json'
ares-launch --device YOUR_TV --close com.openottplay.player.native
ares-launch --device YOUR_TV com.openottplay.player.native
```

Replace the TV/key placeholders with your existing Developer Mode connection.
If file access is denied, use Plex sign-in; do not change platform permissions.
Homebrew installations can use a different app directory. Host development
also accepts an absolute file path in `OTTPLAY_PLEX_PROFILE`. Remove the
transferred file to stop applying it on later starts; a saved session may
still need to be signed out in the app.

This is a managed server connection: before an explicit local-data reset, a
valid file restores it on each cold launch. Sign-out revokes it for the running
session; remove the file and restart to stop future startup imports. In native
0.2, `Delete all local data` also clears app-owned provisioning and persistently
blocks managed startup imports, including `OTTPLAY_PLEX_PROFILE`; replacing a
file does not lift that block. See [local-data reset](../../docs/native-webos-delivery.md#delete-local-data-native-02)
for what is cleared and how to configure the player again.

A Plex Media Server token does not grant Plex account or Home-user features.
Account-scoped local resume positions and preferences are not promised in this
mode; use normal Plex sign-in for a complete account profile.

## Optional Homebrew Channel repository

A working **webOS Homebrew Channel** can install the same IPK. This is the TV
application, not the macOS Homebrew package manager. Add the
[initial native release repository](https://ottplay-webos.igw-2560801.workers.dev/v1/native-webos-v0.1.0-beta.1/ottplay-native-webos-repository.json)
to its repository list, select **OTTPlay Native**, and verify the ID
`com.openottplay.player.native` and version before installing. This URL is a
versioned release snapshot, not a rolling `latest` feed. Use the new native
release's repository URL for a later version and verify its package metadata.
Having Homebrew Channel does not by itself establish that this native decoder
works on the TV.

For maintainers publishing a new native release, generate metadata only after
building, and supply the exact HTTPS directory where these artifacts will be
published:

```sh
python3 native/webos/build.py package \
  --base-url https://downloads.example.org/ottplay-native/0.1.0
python3 native/webos/build.py source
```

Run the runtime-source collector above after `source`. Publish the IPK, both
matching source archives, source-set JSON, icon and repository metadata together.
If metadata and downloads use different hosts, add `--download-base-url` with
the exact HTTPS IPK/source directory; `--base-url` keeps the CORS-compatible
metadata and icon directory. The repository URL ends in
`ottplay-native-webos-repository.json`. Metadata and icon responses must allow
browser CORS; a GitHub release redirect alone may not do so. Generation does
not upload anything, modify the existing OTT-play feed, or imply inclusion in
the central webOSbrew catalog. `rootRequired: false` describes this app, not
how Homebrew Channel was installed. A Developer Mode installation retains its
session lifecycle even when Homebrew Channel performs subsequent installs.

## Source and license

The adapted native runtime and its patches are **GPL-3.0-or-later**. `COPYING`
contains the license; upstream copyright and dependency notices remain in the
package and source archive. This independent executable does not change the
license of the main web player. Distribute the matching two-archive source set along with every binary
candidate, including Cargo/native dependencies, GCC/glibc runtime sources,
Buildroot recipes and all application build scripts. The primary archive
contains the patched upstream tree and this integration under
`ci/ottplay-integration/`; the supplement includes verified final linker
evidence and records which firmware libraries are used but not redistributed.

For an offline reconstruction, extract the source archive and follow its
`ci/restore-source-inputs.py` instructions and upstream source-build document.
The SDK is a separately obtained build toolchain; its exact version and
compiler digest are recorded. Use `RELEASE=1 FLAVOR=stable` when rebuilding.
Telemetry credentials and upstream update endpoints are disabled by our
overlay; the build wrapper also removes inherited telemetry environment
variables.
