# Rust dependency security review

This review covers the application workspace (`Cargo.lock`) and the two
standalone native regression workspaces on 2026-10-08. It also distinguishes
the original upstream lockfiles preserved inside `vendor/` from dependencies
actually selected by the application. It is not a claim that all dependencies
or historical source archives are free of advisories.

## Upgrade

Rebuild the application with the committed lockfile (`cargo build --locked`).
SQLx updates from 0.8.1 to 0.8.6, and `tauri-utils` from 2.9.3 to 2.10.1. These
updates stay within the existing dependency requirements. The Tauri runtime
remains 2.11.5, with the existing Wry, Tao and GLib source patches preserved.

The server now uses the PEM reader supplied by its existing `rustls-pki-types`
dependency, through Rustls, instead of the unmaintained `rustls-pemfile` crate.
Existing certificate chains and PKCS#8 private keys continue to work. The
server still selects the first PKCS#8 key only after parsing the entire file;
malformed later sections fail startup. PKCS#1 and SEC1 private keys are not
newly accepted. No database migration or TLS file conversion is required by
this change.

## Security

The application lockfile no longer selects these seven unmaintained packages:

- `rustls-pemfile`: [RUSTSEC-2025-0134](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0134.html).
- `paste`, previously through `sqlx-core`: [RUSTSEC-2024-0436](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0436.html).
- `unic-char-property`, `unic-char-range`, `unic-common`, `unic-ucd-ident` and
  `unic-ucd-version`, previously through `tauri-utils` → `urlpattern`:
  [2025-0081](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0081.html),
  [2025-0075](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0075.html),
  [2025-0080](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0080.html),
  [2025-0100](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0100.html) and
  [2025-0098](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0098.html).

The following findings remain visible and require future upstream migration:

- `derivative` 2.2.0 and `instant` 0.1.13 are unmaintained
  ([2024-0388](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0388.html),
  [2024-0384](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0384.html)). Both are
  selected through `souvlaki` 0.8.3 → `zbus` 3.15.2 for Linux desktop media
  controls; `instant` is below `async-fs` → `futures-lite` → `fastrand`.
  Souvlaki 0.8.3 is the current published release and requires Zbus 3. Replacing
  that integration needs its own MPRIS compatibility tests. These are not
  dependencies of the standalone server or macOS media-control backend.
- `proc-macro-error` 1.0.4 is unmaintained
  ([2024-0370](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0370.html)). The Linux
  GTK3 build uses it through `gtk3-macros`. It is a build-time procedural macro,
  not server request handling. The standalone native regression workspaces
  also resolve this GTK3 dependency.
- `glib` 0.18.5 still matches the version-based
  [2024-0429](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0429.html) warning.
  The application and both regression workspaces use the local source with
  the exact upstream safety fix. [Vendor provenance](../vendor/README.md)
  documents the patch and tests; the package version is deliberately unchanged.

No audit ignore list or advisory suppression is added. Using RustSec database
commit `b8a1a33e246a0a9a3b5f377248c41a503defec74`, `cargo audit` reports zero
vulnerability records for the application lockfile, three unmaintained-package
warnings and the GLib warning above. Warnings remain part of the review even
when the command exits successfully.

## Preserved upstream source archives

`vendor/tao-0.35.3/Cargo.lock` and `vendor/wry-0.55.1/Cargo.lock` are part of the
original published crate inventories. Cargo selects the application's root
lockfile when these crates are path dependencies; their bundled lockfiles do
not override it. The provenance checkers verify these original files rather
than rewriting or deleting them to change a scanner score.

These two historical lockfiles additionally reference:

- `anyhow` 1.0.102: [2026-0190](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2026-0190.html),
  fixed in 1.0.103; the application resolves 1.0.104.
- `crossbeam-epoch` 0.9.18: [2026-0204](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2026-0204.html),
  fixed in 0.9.20; absent from the application lockfile.
- `memmap2` 0.9.10: [2026-0186](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2026-0186.html),
  fixed in 0.9.11; absent from the application lockfile.
- `quick-xml` 0.39.2/0.39.4:
  [2026-0194](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2026-0194.html) and
  [2026-0195](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2026-0195.html), fixed in
  0.41.0; the application already resolves 0.41.0.
- `ttf-parser` 0.25.1: unmaintained
  [2026-0192](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2026-0192.html); absent from
  the application lockfile.

Do not build those historical crate workspaces as standalone products with
their original lockfiles. A standalone upstream-development build requires
a separate dependency update and review. Repository-wide scanners can still
report these archived dependency versions, as well as `paste` in the archived
locks, after the application's dependencies are updated.

## Reproduce the review

```sh
cargo audit --json
cargo audit --file tests/glib-variant-regression/Cargo.lock --json
cargo audit --file tests/macos-drag-regression/Cargo.lock --json
cargo audit --file vendor/tao-0.35.3/Cargo.lock --json
cargo audit --file vendor/wry-0.55.1/Cargo.lock --json
cargo tree --locked --target all -i derivative
cargo tree --locked --target all -i proc-macro-error
cargo test --locked -p ottplay-core -p ottplay-server
cargo test --locked -p ottplay-tauri
node scripts/check-glib-backport.cjs
node scripts/check-macos-drag-backport.cjs
```

The Tauri tests require the platform's native development libraries. Run the
documented optimized GLib and macOS drag regression tests on their supported
hosts when changing the corresponding patches. Dependency sources retain
their upstream licenses; SQLx and Tauri utilities are MIT/Apache-2.0, and the
existing Rustls PKI types are MIT/Apache-2.0. This update does not relicense the
vendored source archives.
