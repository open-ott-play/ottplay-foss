# Native remote text entry

The embedded Tauri and Capacitor editors use the existing **Swop URL** setting.
Set it explicitly to a trusted installation relay ending in `/swop`, for example
`https://relay.example/swop`. Tauri additionally permits literal loopback HTTP
(`http://127.0.0.1:8443/swop` or `http://[::1]:8443/swop`) for a relay on the same
Mac. iOS and the archived Capacitor Android bridge require HTTPS. There is no
automatic discovery. A phone needs its own reachable HTTPS relay; the Mac's
loopback address is not reachable from a phone.

The dedicated native capability only performs JSON `POST /swop/session` and
`POST /swop/val`. It rejects URL credentials, query strings, fragments, encoded
or normalized paths, redirects and insecure remote HTTP. It supplies fixed JSON
headers, the player ID and an Origin derived from the validated relay URL. This
Origin is a **native assertion**, not browser provenance, authorization or proof
of the relay's identity. TLS verifies a remote relay's certificate. Configure only
an installation you trust with the caption, draft and remotely entered text.
The installation bearer stays exclusively on the relay server; neither the
native bridge nor the player ID is an installation credential.

The dedicated transports use no provider cookie jar, persistent cookies or
stored HTTP credentials. Each request has a ten-second native deadline and a
64 KiB UTF-8 body/response bound. This accommodates the wire limits (caption 200,
draft 4000 and value 8000 UTF-16 code units), including JSON escaping. The relay has
the same byte bound. Worker admission limits are owned by its separate release;
a native/relay update does not imply the Worker or a phone has been updated.

An absent old native method fails explicitly; it cannot fall back to the generic
provider HTTP bridge. jQuery retains its status, JSON/error and abort/timeout
contract. Aborting settles the UI request immediately and discards a late native
result; the underlying native request may continue until its bounded deadline.
The editor's owner also rejects results after cancellation or screen replacement.
Browser installations retain their existing AJAX/same-origin relay behavior and
receive no new native privileges or CORS exceptions.

The Kotlin implementation here is an archived Capacitor regression fixture.
It does not update the standalone `ottplay-android` application or its releases.
