# Tauri desktop smoke (Mode B)

> **Mode B desktop (Tauri).** Sibling of Cap device smoke (`docs/mode-b-device-smoke.md`).
> Debug webview often uses `OTTPLAY_WEB_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8443/`.
> Native PiP: always-on-top `play_pip` / `stop_pip` / `set_pip_bounds`. Unpaid/unsigned OK.
> Helper: `./scripts/smoke-tauri-desktop.sh` - does **not** assert headed play/PiP.

Repeatable **macOS / Windows / Linux** smoke for Mode B Tauri desktop.
FOSS closes what can be automated without a headed GUI in CI: toolchain checks,
`src-tauri/` presence, optional unsigned compile, optional companion curl on `:8443`,
and optional authenticated command-queue curl for an explicitly enabled loopback listener.
Normal playback uses internal IPC; HTTP control is off by default.
**A human still marks the UI checklist** on a desktop window (debug or built app).

This is **Mode B desktop** (Tauri). Do **not** confuse with Mode A companion smokes
(`./scripts/smoke-modea-companion.sh`, `./scripts/smoke-modea-e2e-play.sh`, etc.) — those need
`ottplay-server` / `local_proxy.py` and are HTTP-only against the companion, not Cap/Tauri UI.

## Auto playback in Tauri

The streaming player menu includes `auto` (value 3) in Tauri. Existing explicit
`html5`, `hls.js` and `shaka` preferences keep values 0, 1 and 2. Auto is the default
only for a Tauri provider without a saved player preference; existing HTML5 users
select Auto once and save. Server/browser and Capacitor defaults are unchanged.

Auto starts `.m3u8` URLs with native HLS where supported, using hls.js immediately
on platforms without native HLS. `.mpd` URLs use Shaka; progressive MP4 and other
URLs retain the native path. Query strings and fragments do not affect matching.
Working native video incurs no extra manifest/segment probe.

A native decode/unsupported-source error switches that playback to hls.js once.
WebKit can instead report successful audio-only playback for HEVC inside MPEG-TS,
even with nonzero video dimensions. Auto checks actual audio/video tracks rather
than treating those dimensions as evidence of video playback.
After that state persists for 1.5 seconds, Auto uses a detached hls.js instance to
inspect one fragment, with an 8-second deadline. It switches only when parsed
tracks prove video is present. Radio and inconclusive probes keep HTML5 and renew
the source once, because some proxies invalidate their previous session when a
second client reads the master playlist. A radio stream may briefly reconnect.
Archive/VOD position and the user's pause intent survive the handoff. Stop,
channel changes and a new mode invalidate pending decisions. The same watcher
is used by main playback and the dedicated PiP document.

Use `node tests/test_tauri_auto_playback.cjs` and
`node tests/test_tauri_pip_window.cjs` for deterministic lifecycle regressions.
Runtime acceptance should also exercise H.264/AAC native HLS, HEVC/AAC MPEG-TS,
audio-only HLS and progressive MP4 in the target WebView; unit tests do not prove
decoder support on another operating system.

The video footer measures HLS bitrate from bytes and media duration of the last
eight completed main-stream segments, including muxed audio and container
overhead. hls.js also measures LL-HLS parts. It does not display download bandwidth
or trust manifest BANDWIDTH. All footer refreshes use the same renderer.
Bitrate sampling continues while the footer is hidden, but metadata DOM writes
wait until it opens. An open footer rewrites the label only when the displayed
resolution or rounded bitrate changes. Playback status keeps ownership of the
label while active. Run `node --test tests/test_video_info_dom.cjs` to check these
refresh boundaries and count DOM mutations in a simulated ten-minute workload.

WKWebView does not supply a usable decoded-byte counter for native HLS. For HTTP(S)
`.m3u8` playback (including portal URLs with `extension=m3u8`), the main Tauri
window therefore starts a temporary loopback relay. Query-selected HLS keeps its
signed upstream URL intact; the native decoder receives the loopback playlist
instead of making an HTTP request that macOS App Transport Security can block.
Only requests made by the player fetch upstream media; polling statistics uses
local IPC. Playlists retain their durations and media requests are streamed to the
native decoder. Only completed main segments enter the rolling measurement;
audio renditions, initialization data, retries and incomplete responses do not.
The Auto codec probe uses the same transport. Stop, channel changes, engine
fallback and main-page navigation dispose of the old session.

A transport initialization or playback error retries the original URL directly
once, preserving pause intent and archive position. Unsupported playlist extensions
and HTTP authentication challenges use that direct path. When no reliable media
sample or native byte counter is available (including native LL-HLS parts alone),
the footer shows resolution without Mbps. Run `node tests/test_stream_bitrate.cjs`
and `cargo test --locked -p ottplay-tauri native_hls` for measurement and lifecycle
regressions; verify native decoding and the visible footer in the target WebView.

## What is automated vs human

| Step | Automated? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tools present (`node` / `npm`; optional `cargo` / `rustc`) | Yes (helper) | Soft unless `--require-cargo` |
| `src-tauri/` present | Yes (helper) | Scaffold presence only |
| `npm run build` / `npx tauri build --ci` | Optional (`--build`) | Unsigned CI build inside `src-tauri/` |
| Companion curl on `:8443` | Optional (helper flags) | Soft-skip if not up unless `--require-companion` |
| Optional command-queue HTTP POST/GET | Only after explicit opt-in | Token required; never a normal playback prerequisite |
| UI: window launch / paint / play / PiP | **Human** | Debug or built desktop app |
| Paid notarize / code signing | **Out of scope** | Unpaid: unsigned / local debug OK |

## Prerequisites (unpaid signing OK)

Paid Apple Developer / notarization / Authenticode are **not** required for this smoke.

- **macOS**: Node.js >= 18; Rust toolchain (`cargo` / `rustc`) for build; Xcode Command Line Tools for Tauri system deps
- **Windows**: Node.js >= 18; Rust toolchain; Visual Studio Build Tools
- **Linux**: Node.js >= 18; Rust toolchain; system libs (`webkit2gtk`, `libssl`, etc. per Tauri docs)

No Xcode, Android Studio, CocoaPods, `adb`, or Cap/iOS/Android SDK required.

## Build / run

```bash
npm install
npm run build                  # vite production build
npm run tauri dev              # debug window
npm run tauri build            # unsigned release build
```

Or via helper:

```bash
./scripts/smoke-tauri-desktop.sh --help
./scripts/smoke-tauri-desktop.sh --check-src-tauri
./scripts/smoke-tauri-desktop.sh --build
./scripts/smoke-tauri-desktop.sh --check-companion
./scripts/smoke-tauri-desktop.sh --check-queue
```

Set `OTTPLAY_WEB_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8443` for debug webview pointing at a local Mode A companion.

## Channel list formatting under native CSP

The packaged Tauri page adds a nonce to its style policy. Dynamically inserted
HTML style attributes are therefore blocked, even when the same HTML renders
correctly on the HTTP companion. The shared channel renderer uses external CSS
classes and explicit DOM style properties for trusted layout and theme values.
Provider descriptions still pass through metadata sanitization; the Tauri CSP
and its script/style nonce handling remain enabled.

After building the emitted bundles, run the browser regression in both Chromium
and WebKit:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium webkit
npm run test:native:ui
```

Check programme accents, channel logos, archive markers, progress bars, selection,
and programme details with the same settings and EPG data in both targets.
The browser test enforces the packaged style policy; JSDOM renderer tests alone
do not enforce CSP. Also check the installed native app after replacement.

## Automated companion curl

When a Mode A companion is listening on `:8443`:

```bash
./scripts/smoke-tauri-desktop.sh --check-companion
./scripts/smoke-tauri-desktop.sh --check-companion --require-companion   # fail if down
```

Soft-skip is intentional when the companion is not running — CI without a local companion should not hard-fail.

## Optional authenticated command-queue check

Normal Tauri launch uses internal command IPC with no HTTP listener. Test that default first; do not enable HTTP simply to make a smoke pass.

Enable **Local HTTP remote** in player settings to generate a device code. Settings call `queue_http_configure` with `{enabled: true, token: deviceCode}`; startup environment variables cannot enable the listener. Use the device code as the Bearer token in your local proxy. Disabling the option closes the listener and its connections, clears pending commands, and revokes the active code. The listener binds loopback only, prefers port 18081, and falls back through 18090; `OTTPLAY_QUEUE_PORT` pins a port. `queue_port` reports the live `httpEnabled`, `running`, and `port` status.

```bash
# No token means an intentional soft-skip, without an HTTP request.
./scripts/smoke-tauri-desktop.sh --check-queue
# Only for a deliberately enabled listener, with QUEUE_HTTP_TOKEN already set securely:
./scripts/smoke-command-queue.sh --discover --backend tauri
./scripts/smoke-tauri-desktop.sh --check-queue --require-queue
```

The helper also accepts `OTTPLAY_QUEUE_HTTP_TOKEN`; `QUEUE_BASE_URL` chooses a specific loopback origin instead of discovery. It does not start the listener. The optional contract test enqueues and drains commands, so set a dedicated `DEVICE_ID` to avoid draining the player’s broadcast queue. Never commit or print the token.

## Manual UI checklist (human marks)

Run on **macOS / Windows / Linux** desktop window. Skip rows that need credentials you do not have; note the skip honestly.

### A. Launch + shell

- [ ] App launches without native crash; web UI paints
- [ ] Settings open (F2 / equivalent)
- [ ] Window title / size / position behave normally
- [ ] In both Classic and Modern, Menu → Full screen enters/exits native window fullscreen; the confirmation reports the resulting on/off state
- [ ] In both Classic and Modern, Settings → Interface → Always on top keeps the main window above other applications; selecting it again disables this behavior without changing PiP
- [ ] Settings → Interface → Lock window to 16:9 reports the confirmed preference on supported hosts; both window switches use graphical indicators instead of “select”. A fresh instance defaults to enabled while a saved off value remains off. Enabling it does not immediately resize the window or change video aspect/zoom. An unsupported backend reports Unavailable without saving a new preference
- [ ] These two actions no longer appear in Menu; Full screen remains in Menu
- [ ] Enable Always on top, close and reopen the same app instance: the main window remains on top. Disable it, close and reopen: the main window returns to normal
- [ ] Two separately configured app instances retain independent Always on top preferences
- [ ] Repeated clicks during a pending window change do not cause extra toggles; closing or replacing the originating Menu or Interface page before a reply does not reopen or close another screen
- [ ] Change an ordinary Interface setting without saving, then toggle a native window action: the Interface page, selection and draft remain. Cancel discards the ordinary draft but does not undo the confirmed native action
- [ ] With menus closed, press `L` to enter fullscreen, then `L` again to restore the original window size without clicking or opening Menu
- [ ] Repeat `L` → `Escape` several times; Escape exits fullscreen without opening the app-exit dialog, and the next key still reaches the player
- [ ] Repeat after clicking the video and after opening/closing Menu; keyboard behavior must not depend on the overlay
- [ ] On macOS Tahoe, enter fullscreen with dark video or black letterboxing: all four outer screen edges must be free of a gray 1px window rim, including after switching focus away and back
- [ ] Exit fullscreen: the normal window shadow returns; repeat `L` → `L` and `L` → `Escape` without losing the original size or keyboard focus

Full screen in Menu and the two window actions in Settings → Interface belong to the main Tauri desktop window. They are not shown in browser, TV, mobile or PiP players. A failed native request reports an error instead of confirming an unverified state. After a confirmed native change, Always on top is saved in the current app instance's data directory and restored on its next launch. Missing or invalid preferences use the normal window default. A save failure reports an error; the current window may already have changed, but persistence is not claimed. These controls do not change a provider or restart playback.

Always on top and Lock window to 16:9 apply immediately through the native host; they do not wait for Save Settings. Their successful confirmation leaves Interface open with its other pending edits intact. Cancel does not undo a native window action. Other editable Interface preferences retain their normal Save/Cancel draft behavior. Hiding an old Menu entry does not hide either action in Interface. See [native aspect constraint limits](native-window-aspect-lock.md) for backend support.

On macOS, this checks native WebView focus as well as fullscreen geometry.
Tao changes the window style when entering/exiting simple fullscreen and can
make its container NSView the first responder. The fullscreen command must
restore focus to the WebView on the macOS main dispatch queue after the deferred
style update; otherwise exit can steal focus again. A DOM keyboard test or
focusing only the native window does not verify this behavior.

Simple fullscreen must also disable the native window shadow. macOS Tahoe
includes a gray edge in that shadow even when the window fills the screen;
changing CSS borders does not remove it. Restore the shadow after returning
to windowed mode. See [SDL's corresponding fix](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/15005).

### B. Playback

- [ ] Add an M3U provider (playlist URL you control or a public test list)
- [ ] HTTP localhost playlist (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8090`) loads channels in Tauri Mode B (shim → `proxy_fetch`; not empty 0/0/0)
- [ ] Channel list loads
- [ ] Start playback on one stream (HLS / progressive as available)
- [ ] Pause / resume; volume or wake-lock behavior sanity-check
- [ ] With a valid interface language already loaded, run two `ott PLAYER standby` → `ott PLAYER go` cycles in the same window without reload; repeat for manual and system language modes. Confirm standby drains to `suspended` with `pending: 0`, then the same provider/profile/item resumes with advancing playback; no language settings reopen, and each navigation key produces one action.

### C. PiP (native)

- [ ] Start playback, trigger native PiP (`play_pip`)
- [ ] Window becomes always-on-top compact player
- [ ] Stop PiP (`stop_pip`) returns to normal window
- [ ] Resize / move via `set_pip_bounds` if exercised

### D. EPG / XMLTV

- [ ] Configure a public or operator XMLTV/EPG source you are allowed to use (no secrets in repo)
- [ ] Channel guide / now-next populates for at least one channel
- [ ] Cold start: after playlist names appear, list rows / podval now-next / EPG menu fill once XMLTV warm finishes (startup preload + `epg-cache-ready`; not permanently empty)
- [ ] Airplane mode or kill network briefly → stale cache still serves if previously warm (honest offline path)

### E. Stalker portal (FOSS JSON-RPC)

- [ ] Configure portal URL + MAC for a portal that speaks FOSS `stalker_portal/api/` JSON-RPC
- [ ] Handshake + channel list without Mode A companion `:8443`
- [ ] Play one portal-built stream URL
- [ ] **Skip** if no portal URL — mark "skipped: no portal"

### F. `host_ott` / swop dealer-cloud

- [ ] With `host_ott` / `host_ott_proto` set, Enter Provider Code (remote) or cloud send/load reaches `swop/a.php` via native shim (no CORS failure)
- [ ] **Skip** if no `host_ott` — mark "skipped: no host_ott"
- [ ] Mag `load.php` classic handshake is **not** expected in FOSS (allowlist only) — do not fail smoke for Mag JsHttpRequest gaps

### G. Optional Mode A companions (do not mix into Mode B pass/fail)

Only when you also run a Mode A companion for comparison:

```bash
# Separate stack — not Tauri UI
./scripts/smoke-modea-companion.sh
./scripts/smoke-modea-e2e-play.sh
```

Record Mode A results separately. Tauri desktop smoke **passes** without Mode A.

## Helper script exit codes

`./scripts/smoke-tauri-desktop.sh`:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Checks passed (queue/companion soft-skip counts as pass unless `--require-*`) |
| `1` | Hard failure (missing required tool/dir, build failed, queue/companion required but down) |
| `2` | Queue/companion smoke ran but contract assertion failed |
| `3` | Usage / unknown flag / missing baseline deps (`node`/`npm`/`curl` when needed) |

## Honest remaining human work

- Marking the UI checklist above on desktop window
- Any portal / playlist / `host_ott` credentials (operator-owned; never commit)
- Paid notarize / code signing (store readiness docs only)
- Headless CI that runs a headed Tauri window (intentionally not required here — flaky without xvfb/headless GL)

When the human checklist is done for your targets, the Mode B **desktop smoke** gap is closed for FOSS; DRM and Mag JsHttpRequest remain separate Remaining items in `tauri-updater-notarize.md`.


### Isolated Windows window controls check

The Windows native CI job builds `window_controls_smoke` and runs
`scripts/check-window-controls.py`. It does not start an installed player or
load any player profile. To repeat the check from the repository root on Windows:

```powershell
cargo test --locked -p ottplay-tauri window_controls::tests
cargo test --locked -p ottplay-tauri fullscreen_confirmation_tests
cargo build --locked -p ottplay-tauri --example window_controls_smoke
python scripts/check-window-controls.py
```

The fixture registers the production commands and uses the same JavaScript IPC
and event round-trip as the screenshot smoke. Its positive configuration uses
production capabilities. A second configuration allows only fixture reply
events: topmost, fullscreen set and fullscreen toggle must all fail through the
actual ACL. The auxiliary `pip` window must be denied main-window topmost access.
An IPC timeout is a failure, never evidence of an ACL denial.

The positive run applies topmost on/on/off/off and compares the returned state,
Tauri readback and Win32 `WS_EX_TOPMOST`. It then enters and exits fullscreen with
topmost both off and on, checks the native monitor rectangle and restores the
original window rectangle. It also exercises explicit fullscreen set (the Escape
path), confirms that the auxiliary window is unchanged, and restores both flags.
Geometry is polled for at most two seconds per transition because Windows may
finish applying it after the API state changes. Commands are never retried to
make the test pass.

Three more independent fixture processes share only a fresh, parent-owned
preference directory. The first confirms a normal initial window and enables
Always on top through the production IPC command. The second uses the same
startup preference loader as the application, confirms both Tauri and Win32
report on-top before any IPC, and disables it. The third confirms the next
initial window is normal without changing it. The runner checks the saved bytes
after each phase. These checks exercise the shared restoration path and actual
native window creation; they do not launch the full player or replace its manual
relaunch and multi-instance UI checklist.

Each process has a hard 30-second internal deadline. The parent runner has a
40-second process deadline and terminates only the PID tree it created. Normal
completion destroys only its two fixture windows. Private WebView data is created
in a fresh temporary directory and removed by the parent after exit. Evidence
and bounded failure logs are saved under `build/windows-window-controls-report/`
and uploaded even if the CI step fails. Compilation and runtime failures both
fail CI; no hardware acceptance is implied by source checks alone.

Menu, L and Escape share a request epoch. An older reply cannot overwrite a newer
fullscreen request's state; an obsolete legacy fallback cannot issue another
fullscreen mutation. Fullscreen native commands propagate getter/setter errors
and reject readback mismatches instead of reporting the requested state as a
confirmed result. On macOS, a mismatch can reflect an unfinished Spaces transition;
the command reads again at 25 ms intervals for at most three seconds, without
repeating its setter. Admission is checked against the actual clock after waking,
before reading, and after reading: a matching result at or after the deadline is
not accepted as success. Read errors are terminal. A failed readback does not imply
that an earlier native setter rolled back.

Keyboard helpers select an available bridge before dispatch. Once a mutating IPC
has been attempted, any rejection (including a synchronous exception), malformed
response or ambiguous transport error is terminal for that request. It must not
try another bridge or the legacy window setter: the first mutation may already
have applied. An unknown-command message is not classified by substring to permit
a retry. Direct IPC acknowledgements must contain a boolean fullscreen state;
missing state or explicit failure cannot be replaced with the requested value.
The two Rust test groups run as separate Windows CI steps, so one successful exit
code cannot hide another group's failure.

### Windows test manifests

The MSVC build embeds `src-tauri/windows-app-manifest.xml` in every executable,
including library tests and the isolated window-control example. The file is an
unchanged copy of the default in the locked `tauri-build` 2.6.3 crate; retain its
Common-Controls 6 dependency when updating that build dependency. Tauri still
generates the application icon and version resources. GNU Windows and other
targets keep the normal Tauri build path.

Windows CI extracts `RT_MANIFEST` as data before launching the test executable or
example, compares its complete XML structure with the checked-in default, and
retains the XML and executable hashes in the window-control evidence. This avoids
confusing a loader failure (`STATUS_ENTRYPOINT_NOT_FOUND`) with a failing test.
The regular IPC, ACL, fullscreen, and installer lifecycle tests remain required.
See the [upstream diagnosis](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/13419).
